<!--
The Rating type defines four different categories indicating how good the
compared values match. The ranking of the categories from best to worst is:
EXCELLENT -> GOOD -> AVERAGE -> POOR. Each category will correspond to a rating
value which indicates the score being achieved in that particular category.
-->

<!--a
The Rating interval type defines the boundaries of the difference intervals
defined by the rating type categories. It is assumed that the first interval
starts with a difference value of 0. The excellent category then defines the
interval beginning at zero and ending at the "excellent" value. The good
category defines the interval from "excellent" to "good", the average category
falls into the interval from "good" to "average" and all values inferior the
"average" value belong to the poor category.
